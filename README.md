# VnqBot

Fairly basic Discord Bot that pulls data from a Shivtr guild site calendar of events. 
The bot then sends out alerts to preset channels every day of the daily docket of events including the daily pledges.
The bot also sends an alert when an event is 45 minutes from start time.
There are several commands as well that can be issued to get immediate info. These are covered in the !help command.
